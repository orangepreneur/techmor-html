                <partial name="faq.html" title="How does TechMor AI Underwriting Work?">
                    <p class="mb-3"> It’s simple but counter-intuitive: </p>
                    <p class="mb-3"> At the time a file is ready to be underwritten for an Initial Underwriting Submission,
                        Re-Submission, Final Submission, Pre-Funding QC or Post Closing/Prior to Shipping or Prior to
                        Purchase Review…</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"> Then TechMor makes a complete copy of all available documents from your LOS platform, transfers
                        them securely to our AI Underwriting Platform…</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"> Where every document is reindexed, all the data is harvested into data arrays of up to 5,200
                        elements per borrower…</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"> Then the AI Platform Underwriting Rule Set runs based on Agency, FHA, VA and/or NonQM Guidelines
                        and each client’s Credit Policy Overlays…</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"> Which generates all of the Underwriting Work Papers, Conditions and Trued-Up Data Set all of
                        which are then Posted Back into each clients LOS, including rerunning AUS, Fraud, and other
                        reports impacted by the Data Set True-Up such that Updated LOS data matches all of the
                        supporting documents.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"> Then either TechMor Publishes the Conditional Loan Approval or the client’s own Underwriter
                        conducts a quick Second Level Review and themselves publishes the Results.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Our TechMor AI Underwriting Platform frees up your Underwriters to handle resubs, coach your
                        counter-parties and maximize Clear to Closes per day achieving rates as high as 8 or more CTC’s
                        per day, per Underwriter vs manual underwriting at 2 CTC’s per day.</p>
                </partial>
                <partial name="faq.html" title="How quickly can TechMor AI Underwriting be ramped to full scale?">
                    <p class="mb-3">Because the TechMor AI Underwriting Platform is fully configured for Agency, FHA, VA and Non-QM
                        base programs, only four steps are required to engage and ramp up:</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Client creates LOS User Credentials for TechMor, then we start by Underwriting 2-3 files per day
                        for a week in order to Apply and Calibrate Client Credit Policy Overlays.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Our AI Base Platform is intentionally designed to conservatively over-condition until we can
                        confirm which conditions may be automatically applied by each client’s LOS along with each
                        clients preference for over or under condition especially depending up the stage of the loan
                        when we are underwriting.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">This will be very difference for Call Center file fresh of the LO’s desk with barely an
                        supporting documents vs a TPO/Wholesale or Non-Del file that comes in with everything including
                        Appraisal and Inspection documents.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">During week 2 we ramp up to 10-15 files per subject to each client’s ability to execute full 2nd
                        Level Reviews on 100% of the files and provide us Calibration Feedback.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">The we scale up at the of 25 to 50 files per week each week thereafter and the client switches to
                        2nd Level Review 10-20% sampling and continue that process for 4 to 8 weeks until we are
                        achieving 100% file reviews for each client channel.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">We can achieve any Daily Underwriting File Volume required to meet a client’s full capacity per
                        channel for up to 10,000 files per month or 500 Files per Day within 12 weeks.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Our TechMor AI Underwriting Platform frees up your Underwriters to handle resubs, coach your
                        counterparties and maximize Clear to Closes per day achieving rates as high as 8 or more CTC’s
                        per day, per Underwriter vs manual underwriting at 2 CTC’s per day once we achieve full capacity
                        for your channels in that 12th week or so. </p>

                    <p class="mb-3"> Our TechMor AI Underwriting Platform is fully configured for Agency, FHA, VA and Non-QM base
                        programs all hardened through engagements with other clients with a framework specifically
                        designed to accommodate each client’s Credit Policy Overlays and those of their primary
                        investors.</P>
                    <p class="mb-3"> We implement a fully dedicated instance of the TechMor AI Platform in AWS for each client, then
                        for each channel operated by each client. </P>
                    <p class="mb-3"> This enables clients to vary credit policies across channels where tolerances can vary
                        substantially.</P>
                    <p class="mb-3">To keep in sync with our clients, we have a team that monitors client Credit Policy and Investor
                        Overlay Updates within each client’s business by being issued one or more client specific email
                        credentials then being included in all Underwriting and Credit Team communication.</P>
                    <p class="mb-3">We never implement a change without first confirming the proposed change with each client as
                        clients adopt Agency, Govy and Non-QM Investor policy changes with different lead times.</P>
                    <p class="mb-3">Our AI Underwriting Platform fully supports the notion of Vintages of Guidelines and Credit
                        Policy Overlays such as how HUD Mortgagee letters take effect “On or After” a specific date in
                        the future as they are published.</P>
                    <p class="mb-3">This capability is especially important for clients who aggregate production the sell to specific
                        investors such as Non-QM channels where Credit Overlays and LLPA’s can be updated as frequently
                        as weekly but are always keyed to “loans originated on or after” a specific future date.</P>
                        <p class="mb-3">The loan parameter driven framework enables clients to audit back against the prevailing
                        guidelines as they perform the QC in arrears or even annually such is our experience.</p>
                </partial>
                <partial name="faq.html" title="How does TechMor AI Underwriting Platform support my Non-QM Programs?">
                   <p class="mb-3"> Our TechMor AI Underwriting Framework for Non-QM includes support specifically for a half dozen Non-QM Investor and their programs but the majority of the production in our experience is for either High Credit Quality or Lower Credit Quality variations of Bank Statement, Full Doc Approved In-Eligible, Foreign National / TIN and DSCR based loans.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">TechMor has supported pioneering lender clients in the Non-QM space since 2017 where we have enabled them to become Fully Delegated by multiple Non-QM Investors.  As we transformed our business from 2017 to 2019 to the AI Underwriting Platform, our framework was developed specifically to support client Credit Policy Overlays and Vintages of Updates that apply to loans originated “on or after” designated Credit Policy Implementation dates.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">This includes supporting those clients who essentially homogenize the Guidelines, Overlays and LLPAs of their available Non-QM Investors and present the resulting single guideline as a range of product to their channels as “house programs”.</p>
                   <p class="mb-3"> Moreover, our leadership team was part of the generation of Lenders and Investors who supported the rapid rise and fall of ALT-A programs during their heyday and that experience informed our approach to Non-QM.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">That legacy ALT-A experience and our Forensic Defense Underwriting from 2008 to 2015 contributed substantially to our AI Underwriting Platform approach whereby we only trust the documents, we never trust the indexing provided to us and always reindex to our perfection especially to establish document provenance, then we harvest our nearly 5,200 data elements per borrower and then we underwrite the file.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">While the Non-QM is governed by its own set of program specific income and/or ratio guidelines, all Non-QM programs are at their foundation Agency loans whereby we have to prove that the borrower was Ineligible for the Non-QM loan can be offered and our program fully support this process with the required Underwriting Work Papers and other supporting documents and disclosures.  </p>

                            <p class="mb-3">But unlike legacy vendors, our AI Platform can literally process thousands of files per day including generating Servicing Onboarding Datasets along with isolating the key documents required for servicing.  </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">We can literally enable MSR or Whole Loan Servicing Trades that would require months of lead time with legacy vendors in cycle times measured in Days not Weeks.</p>

                        <partial name="faq.html" title="Does the TechMor AI Underwriting Platform handle Post Closing or Prior to Purchase Reviews?">
                            <p class="mb-3">Based on our extensive experience 2008 to 2015 handling Forensic Defense Underwriting for Lenders defending themselves in very high-profile litigation, we bring a unique view to Post Closing, Prior to Shipping and Prior to Purchase Reviews.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">In all cases, we ingest a copy of all available documents for each loan into our AI Underwriting Platform, reindex them, extract up to 5,200 data elements per borrower and then run the AI rules applicable to the specific program type with any applicable Client Credit Policy Overlays or Investor specific Overlays or LLPAs.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">At the option of our clients, we can conduct essentially the same review that any investor would conduct, this enables Cure then Ship approach for Correspondent Sellers instead of the legacy approach of Ship, get Stip’d by the Investor, then spend weeks curing loans that later get discounted and otherwise penalized.  </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">This can increase net execution for Correspondent Sellers to generate more higher net sale prices per loan generating an increase income that alone can offset the cost of our reviews.  This due to the cycle time reduction to 24 hours all the time and shipping perfected file instead of files with undiscovered defects.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">Our reviews can be limited to file integrity, enforceability, compliance and Investor Overlays, or it can be full re-underwriting review.  We can also apply the full underwriting review to specific sample percentages or risk profile loans per Lender or per pool of loans.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">We conduct our Mini-Corr, Non-Del and Fully Delegated Correspondent Prior to Purchase Reviews all on a maximum 24 hour turn time. Depending upon client specific requirements and LOS capabilities, we can complete reviews in as short as 4-6 hours to get Stips out fast.  We can even replace their inbound Closed Loan Package Indexing and simply post our perfected document set to their LOS or Imaging platform.</p>
